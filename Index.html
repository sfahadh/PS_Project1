          <div class="summaryArticle">
            <p> It seems that the notorious Kingpin, crime boss extraordinaire, has pulled together a cavalcade of genius scientists and created a machine capable of breaking through multiple dimensions of reality. Those alternate realities are all quite similar to our own, but all slightly different, too. And when you mess with the balance between them, well, things might just go boom in all of them!</p>
            <p> Peter Parker, our friendly neighborhood spider-guy is fighting back, but not before a radioactive arachnid from another dimension slips through and bites a local kid named Miles. Just like that, Miles Morales is shocked to find that he's able to stick to walls and scramble across the ceiling.
            </p>
            <p> Then a dimensional rift sucks five other Spider-Beings into our reality. And when Peter Parker goes down, things start to get really sticky. But it turns out all of those other extradimensional Spideys are actually pretty capable. Still, if they're ever going to get back to their own worlds, it's up to the young and totally inexperienced Miles to fix things.</p>
            <p> To do so, he'll need to rally all of these alternate-reality web-slingers, master a few new spider-skills himself, stop the Kingpin and somehow keep the entire space-time continuum from imploding.</p>

        <h2 class="Opinion">My Review on the Spider-Man Into the Spider Verse Movie</h1>
        <hr>
        <p class="MyReview">This movie is so much greater than I expected it to be. It is unfortunate that the trailer didn't capture the great story and essence of the film. I was only brought upon to watch this film upon my cousin's recommendation.</p>
        <p class="MyReview">It is a full-on, fun adventure, all ignited by the film's rhapsodic animation, a dazzling collision of traditional comic-book style images and digital wizardry that give the film the warm feel of the pulpy medium from which the superhero genre sprang.</p>
